Sick of this Hero 7 messing up my footage.

At some stage this script will brute-force the deshuffling pattern by running ffmpeg on every permutation of a sequence of frames, incrementing the length of the block of frames it tries to deshuffle with each pass.

Buy a new Gopro man, it's not worth it. Unless it is. I don't judge. This program might save you :D
